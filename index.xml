      <description>The goal of the project is to use the methods we have learned in class and extend our knowledge in smaller groups. Below is an example of a project description. If your group has an alternative proposal, please schedule time to discuss with me prior to the proposal due date.
One example project is to first to identify an article in the scientific/statistical literature that reports on a Monte Carlo study that was conducted to evaluate a statistical method.</description>

      <description>Course Objectives Computationally intensive statistical methods are a key component to modern data analysis methods. After completing this course, a successful student will be able to use statistical software to implement both traditional and state-of-the-art methods in computational statistics as well as recognize situations where these methods are required.
 COVID-19 Important information for students: All students are expected and required to report any COVID-19 symptoms to the university immediately, as well as exposures or positive tests from a non-CSU testing location.</description>
