We will start the class with some tools that will be useful for success in this class. Going forward, we will use these tools for any [computing]{.red} and [data analysis]{.red} tasks.

In STAT400, we will cover each part of the data analysis pipeline using

1. Tools like `R` and RStudio

2. Packages in `R`

3. Computational ideas in Statistics (implemented in `R`)

# `R`

`R` (https://www.r-project.org) is a free, open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is available for every major platform. 

RStudio (https://rstudio.com) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for `R`. It is also free, open source, and available for every major platform. It makes data analysis and projects in `R` go a bit smoother.

## Getting Started

We can use `R` like an overgrown calculator.

```{r}
# simple math
5*(10 - 4) + 44

# integer division
7 %/% 2

# modulo operator (Remainder)
7 %% 2

# powers
1.5^3
```

<br />

We can use mathematical functions.

```{r}
# exponentiation
exp(1)

# logarithms
log(100)
log(100, base = 10)

# trigonometric functions
sin(pi/2)
cos(pi)
asin(1)
```

<br />
<br />

We can create variables using the assignment operator `<-`,

```{r}
# create some variables
x <- 5
class <- 400
hello <- "world"
```

and then use those variables in our functions.

```{r}
# functions of variables
log(x)
class^2
```

There are some rules for variable naming.

Variable names --

1. Can't start with a number.

2. Are case-sensitive.

3. Can be the name of a predefined internal function or letter in `R` (e.g., c, q, t, C, D, F, T, I). Try [not]{.red} to use these.

4. Cannot be reserved words that `R` (e.g., for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next).

## Vectors

Variables can store more than one value, called a *vector*. We can create vectors using the combine (`c()`) function.

```{r}
# store a vector
y <- c(1, 2, 6, 10, 17)
```

When we perform functions on our vector, the result is elementwise.

```{r}
# elementwise function
y/2
```

A vector must contain all values of the same type (i.e., numeric, integer, character, etc.).

[ ]{.pagebreak}

[**Your Turn**]{.yourturn}

1. Use the `rep()` function to construct the following vector: `1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5`

2. Use `rep()` to construct this vector: `1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5`

[ ]{.pagebreak}

We can also make sequences of numbers using either `:` or `seq()`

```{r}
# sequences
a <- 1:5
a
b <- seq(1, 5, by = 1)
b
```

and we can **extract** values by index.

```{r}
a[3]
```

Indexing is pretty powerful.

```{r}
# indexing multiple items
a[c(1, 3, 5)]
a[1:3]
```

We can even tell `R` which elements we don't want.

```{r}
a[-3]
```

And we can index by **logical** values. `R` has logicals built in using `TRUE` and `FALSE` (`T` and `F` also work, but can be overwritten). Logicals can result from a comparison using

- `<` : "less than"
- `>` : "greater than"
- `<=` : "less than or equal to"
- `>=` : "greater than or equal to"
- `==` : "is equal to"
- `!=` : "not equal to"

```{r}
# indexing by vectors of logicals
a[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]

# indexing by calculated logicals
a < 3
a[a < 3]
```

[ ]{.pagebreak}

[**Your Turn**]{.yourturn}

1. Create a vector of 1300 values evenly spaced between 1 and 100.

2. How many of these values are greater than 791? (Hint: see `sum()` as a helpful functions.)

[ ]{.pagebreak}

We can combine elementwise logical vectors in the following way:

- `&` : elementwise AND
- `|` : elementwise OR

```{r}
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) | c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) & c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
```


There are two more useful functions for looking at the start (head) and end (tail) of a vector.

```{r}
head(a, 2)
tail(a, 2)
```

We can also modify elements in a vector.

```{r}
a[1] <- 0
a[c(4, 5)] <- 100
a
```

[ ]{.pagebreak}

[**Your Turn**]{.yourturn}

Using the vector you created of 1300 values evenly spaced between 1 and 100,

1. Modify the elements greater than 1000 to equal 9999.

2. View (not modify) the first 100 values in your vector.

[ ]{.pagebreak}

As mentioned, elements of a vector must all be the same type. So, changing an element of a vector to a different type will result in all elements being converted to the *most general* type.

```{r}
a
a[1] <- ":-("
a
```

By changing a value to a string, all the other values were also changed.

There are many data types in `R`, numeric, integer, character (i.e., string), Date, and factor being the most common. We can convert between different types using the `as` series of functions.

```{r}
as.character(b)
```

There are a whole variety of useful functions to operate on vectors. A couple of the more common ones are `length`, which returns the length (number of elements) of a vector, and `sum`, which adds up all the elements of a vector.

```{r}
n <- length(b)
n
sum_b <- sum(b)
sum_b
```

We can then create some statistics!

```{r}
mean_b <- sum_b/n
sd_b <- sqrt(sum((b - mean_b)^2)/(n - 1))
```

But, we don't have to.

```{r}
mean(b)
sd(b)
summary(b)
quantile(b, c(.25, .75))
```

## Data Frames

Data frames are the data structure you will (probably) use the most in `R`. You can think of a data frame as any sort of rectangular data. It is easy to conceptualize as a table, where wach column is a vector. Recall, each vector must have the same data type *within* the vector (column), but columns in a data frame need not be of the same type. Let's look at an example!

```{r}
# look at top 6 rows
head(iris)

# structure of the object
str(iris)
```

This is Anderson's Iris data set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), available by default in `R`.

Some facts about data frames:

- Structured by rows and columns and can be indexed
- Each column is a variable of one type
- Column names or locations can be used to index a variable
- Advice for naming variables applys to naming columns
- Can be specified by grouping vectors of equal length as columns

Data frames are indexed (similarly to vectors) with `[ ]`. 

- `df[i, j]` will select the element of the data frame in the `i`th row and the `j`th column.
- `df[i, ]` will select the entire `i`th row as a data frame
- `df[ , j]` will select the entire `j`th column as a vector

We can use logicals or vectors to index as well.

```{r}
iris[1, ]
iris[, 1]
iris[1, 1]
```

We can also select columns by name in two ways.

```{r}
iris$Species
iris[, "Species"]
```

To add columns, create a new vector that is the same length as other columns. We can append new column to the data frame using the `$` operator or the `[]` operators.

```{r}
# make a copy of iris
my_iris <- iris

# add a column
my_iris$sepal_len_square <- my_iris$Sepal.Length^2  
head(my_iris)
```

It's quite easy to subset a data frame.

```{r}
my_iris[my_iris$sepal_len_square < 20, ]
```

We'll see another way to do this in Section \@ref(tidyverse).

We can create new data frames using the `data.frame()` function,

```{r}
df <- data.frame(NUMS = 1:5, 
                 lets = letters[1:5],
                 cols = c("green", "gold", "gold", "gold", "green"))
```

and we can change column names using the `names()` function.

```{r}
names(df)
names(df)[1] <- "nums"

df
```

[ ]{.pagebreak}

[**Your Turn**]{.yourturn}

1. Make a data frame with column 1: `1,2,3,4,5,6` and column 2: `a,b,a,b,a,b`

2. Select only rows with value "a" in column 2 using logical vector

3. `mtcars` is a built-in data set like `iris`: Extract the 4th row of the mtcars data.

[ ]{.pagebreak}

There are other data structures available to you in `R`, namely lists and matrices. We will not cover these in the notes, but I encourage you to read more about them (https://faculty.nps.edu/sebuttre/home/R/lists.html and https://faculty.nps.edu/sebuttre/home/R/matrices.html).

## Basic Programming

We will cover three basic programming ideas: functions, conditionals, and loops.

### Functions

We have used many functions that are already built into `R` already. For example -- `exp()`, `log()`, `sin()`, `rep()`, `seq()`, `head()`, `tail()`, etc.

But what if we want to use a function that doesn't exist?

**We can write it!**

Idea: We want to avoid repetitive coding because errors will creep in.
Solution: Extract common core of the code, wrap it in a function, and make it reusable.

The basic structure for writing a function is as follows:

- Name
- Input arguments (including names and default values)
- Body (code)
- Output values

```{r}
# we store a function in a named value
# function is itself a function to create functions!
# we specify the inputs that we can use inside the function
# we can specify default values, but it is not necessary
name <- function(input = FALSE) {
  # body code goes here
  
  # return output vaues
  return(input)
}
```

Here is a more realistic first example:

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x) {
  sum(x)/length(x)
}
```

Let's test it out.

```{r}
my_mean(1:15)
my_mean(c(1:15, NA))
```

Some advice for function writing:

1. Start simple, then extend. 
2. Test out each step of the way. 
3. Don’t try too much at once.

### Conditionals

Conditionals are functions that control the flow of analysis. Conditionals determine if a specified condition is met (or not), then direct subsequent analysis or action depending on whether the condition is met (or not).

```{r eval=FALSE}
if(condition) {
  # Some code that runs if condition is TRUE
} else {
  # Some code that runs if condition is TRUE
}
```

- `condition` is a length one logical value, i.e. either `TRUE` or `FALSE`
- We can use `&` and `|` to combine several conditions 
- `!` negates condition

For example, if we wanted to do something with `na.rm` from our function,

```{r eval=FALSE}
if(na.rm) x <- na.omit(x) # na.omit is a function that removes NA values
```

might be a good option.

### Loops

Loops (and their cousins the `apply()` function) are useful when we want to repeat the same block of code many times. Reducing the amount of typing we do can be nice, and if we have a lot of code that is essentially the same we can take advantage of looping. `R` offers several loops: for, while, repeat.

For loops will run through a specified index and perform a set of code for each value of the indexing variable.

```{r eval=FALSE}
for(i in index values) {
  # block of code
  # can print values also
  # code in here will most likely depend on i
}
```

```{r}
for(i in 1:3) {
  print(i)
}
```

```{r}
for(species in unique(iris$Species)) {
  subset_iris <- iris[iris$Species == species,]
  avg <- mean(subset_iris$Sepal.Length)
  print(paste(species, avg))
}
```

While loops will run until a specified condition is no longer true.

```{r}
condition <- TRUE
while(condition) {
  # do stuff
  # don't forget to eventually set the condition to false
  # in the toy example below I check if the current seconds is divisible by 5
  time <- Sys.time()
  if(as.numeric(format(time, format = "%S")) %% 5 == 0) condition <- FALSE
}
print(time)
```

```{r}
# we can also use while loops to iterate
i <- 1
while (i <= 5) {
    print(i)
    i <- i + 1
}
```

[ ]{.pagebreak}

[**Your Turn**]{.yourturn}

1. Alter your `my_mean()` function to take a second argument (`na.rm`) with default value `FALSE` that removes `NA` values if `TRUE`.

2. Add checks to your function to make sure the input data is either numeric or logical. If it is logical convert it to numeric.

3. The diamonds data set is included in the `ggplot2` package (not by default in `R`). It can be read into your environment with the following function.

    ```{r}
    data("diamonds", package = "ggplot2")
    ```

    Loop over the columns of the diamonds data set and apply your mean function to all of the numeric columns (Hint: look at the `class()` function).

[ ]{.pagebreak}


## Packages

Commonly used `R` functions are installed with base `R`.

`R` packages containing more specialized `R` functions can be installed freely from CRAN servers using function `install.packages()`.

After packages are installed, their functions can be loaded into the current `R` session using the function `library()`.

Packages are contrbuted by `R` users just like you! 

We will use some great packages in this class. Feel free to venture out and find your favorites (google R package + what you're trying to do to find more packages).

## Additional resources

You can get help with `R` functions within `R` by using the `help()` function, or typing `?` before a function name.

Stackoverflow can be helpful -- if you have a question, maybe somebody else has already asked it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r).

# ggplot2

We will be using the `ggplot2` package for doing graphics in this class.

The first time on your machine you’ll need to install the package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Whenever you first want to plot during an `R` session, we need to load the library. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Why visualize?

The sole purpose of visualization is communication. Visualization offers an alternative way of communicating numbers than simply using tables. Often, we can get more information out of our numbers graphically than with numerical summaries alone. Through the use of [exploratory data analysis]{.red}, we can see what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

For example, let's look at the following dataset.

```{r}
anscombe
```

Anscombe's Quartet is comprised of 4 datasets that have nearly identical simple statistical properties. Each dataset contains 11 (x, y) points with the same mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient between x and y.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

anscombe %>%
  gather(variable, value) %>%
  separate(variable, into = c("variable", "dataset"), sep = 1) %>%
  group_by(variable, dataset) %>%
  mutate(id = 1:n()) %>%
  spread(variable, value) %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarise(mean_x = mean(x), sd_x = sd(x),
            mean_y = mean(y), sd_y = sd(y),
            cor = cor(x, y)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

But this doesn't tell the whole story. Let's look closer at these datasets.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
anscombe %>%
  gather(variable, value) %>%
  separate(variable, into = c("variable", "dataset"), sep = 1) %>%
  group_by(variable, dataset) %>%
  mutate(id = 1:n()) %>%
  spread(variable, value) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x, y), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(.~dataset)
```

Visualizations can aid communication and make the data easier to perceive. It can also show us things about our data that numerical summaries won't necessarily capture.

## A Grammar of Graphics

The grammar of graphics was developed by Leland Wilkinson (https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447). It is a set of grammatical rules for creating perceivable graphs. Rather than thinking about a limited set of graphs, we can think about graphical forms. This abstraction makes thinking, creating, and communicating graphics easier.

Statistical graphic specifications are expressed using the following components.

1. **data**: a set of data operations that create variables from datasets
2. **trans**: variable transformations
3. **scale**: scale transformations
4. **coord**: a coordinate system
5. **element**: graphs (points) and their aesthetic attributes (color)
6. **guide**: one or more guides (axes, legends, etc.)

`ggplot2` is a package written by Hadley Wickham (https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) that implements the ideas in the grammar of graphics to create layered plots.

`ggplot2` uses the idea that you can build every graph with graphical components from three sources

1. the data, represented by `geom`s
2. the scales and coordinate system
3. the plot annotations 

This works by mapping values in the data to visual properties of the geom (aesthetics) like size, color, and locations.

Let's build a graphic. We start with the data. We will use the `diamonds` dataset, and we want to explor the relationship between carat and price.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)
```

Next we need to specify the aesthetic (variable) mappings.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price))
```

Now we choose a geom to display our data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()
```

And add an aesthetic to our plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut))
```

We could add another layer.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = cut), method = "lm")
```

And finally, we can specify coordinate transformations.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = cut), method = "lm") +
  scale_y_sqrt()
  
```

Notice we can add on to our plot in a layered fashion.

## Graphical Summaries

There are some basic charts we will use in this class that cover a wide range of cases. For univariate data, we can use dotplots, histograms, and barcharts. For two dimensional data, we can look at scatterplots and boxplots.

### Scatterplots

Scatterplots are used for investigating relationships between two numeric variables. To demonstrate some of the flexibility of scatterplots in `ggplot2`, let's answer the following question.

> Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?

We will use the `mpg` dataset in the `ggplot2` package to answer the question. This dataset contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

```{r}
dim(mpg)
summary(mpg)
head(mpg)
```

`mpg` contains the following variables: `displ`, a car’s engine size, in litres, and `hwy`, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy))
```

So we can say, yes, cars with larger engines have worse fuel efficiency. But there is more going on here.

```{r echo = FALSE}
mpg %>%
  mutate(outlier = displ > 5 & hwy > 20) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, colour = outlier, size = outlier)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) +
  scale_size_manual(values = 1:2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

The red points above seem to have higher `mpg` than they should based on engine size alone (outliers). Maybe there is a confounding variable we've missed. The `class` variable of the mpg dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, colour = class))
```

The colors show that many of the unusual points are two-seater cars, probably sports cars! Sports cars have large engines like SUVs and pickup trucks, but small bodies like midsize and compact cars, which improves their gas mileage.

Instead of color, we could also map a categorical variable (like `class`) to shape, size, and transparency (`alpha`).

So far we have mapped aesthetics to variables in our dataset. What happens if we just want to generally change the aesthetics of our plots, without tying that to data? We can specify general aesthetics as parameters of the `geom`, instead of specifying them as aesthetics (`aes`).

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy), colour = "darkgreen", size = 2)
```

When interpreting a scatterplot we can look for big patterns in our data, as well as form, direction, and strength of relationships. Additionally, we can see small patterns and deviations from those patterns (outliers).

[ ]{.pagebreak}

[**Your Turn**]{.yourturn}

1. Make a scatterplot of `cty` vs. `hwy` mpg using the `mpg` dataset.

2. Describe the relationship that you see.

3. Map color and shape to type of drive the car is (see `?mpg` for details on the variables.). Do you see any patterns?

4. Alter your plot from part 3. to make all the points be larger.

[ ]{.pagebreak}


### Histograms, Barcharts, and Boxplots

We can look at the distribution of continuous variables using **histograms** and **boxplots** and the distribution of discrete variables using **barcharts**.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(hwy), bins = 30) 
## boxplots will look very different sometimes with different binwidths

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(drv, hwy)) 
## boxplots allow us to see the distribution of a cts rv conditional on a discrete one
## we can also show the actual data at the same time
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(drv, hwy)) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(drv, hwy), alpha = .5)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(drv)) 
## shows us the distribution of a categorical variable
```

### Facets

So far we've looked at 

1. how one (or more) variables are distributed - barchart or histogram
2. how two variables are related - scatterplot, boxplot
3. how two variables are related, conditioned on other variables - color

Sometimes color isn't enough to show conditioning because of crowded plots.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut))
```

When this is the case, we can *facet* to display plots for different subsets. To do this, we specify row variables ~ column variables (. for none).

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ cut)
```

If instead we have two variables we want to facet by, we can use `facet_grid()`.

```{r, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) +
  facet_grid(color ~ cut)
```

[ ]{.pagebreak}

[**Your Turn**]{.yourturn}

Using the `mpg` dataset,

1. Make a histogram of `hwy`, faceted by `drv`.

2. Make a scatterplot that incorporates color, shape, size, and facets.

3. BONUS - Color your histograms from 1. by `cyl`. Did this do what you thought it would? (Look at `fill` and `group` as options instead).

# tidyverse

The tidyverse is a suite of packages released by RStudio that work very well together ("verse") to make data analysis run smoothly ("tidy"). It's also a package in `R` that loads all the packages in the tidyverse at once.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

You actually already know one member of the tidyverse -- `ggplot2`! We will highlight three more packages in the tidyverse for data analysis.

## `readr`

The first step in (almost) any data analysis task is reading data into `R`. Data can take many formats, but we will focus on text files.

> But what about `.xlsx`??

File extensions `.xls` and `.xlsx` are proprietary Excel formats/ These are binary files (meaning if you open one outside of Excel it will not be human readable). An alternable for rectangular data is a `.csv`.

`.csv` is an extension for *comma separated value* files. They are text files -- directly readable -- where each column is separated by a comma and each row a new line.

```
president,president_name,title,date,city,state,building,room
33,Harry Truman,Commencement Address at Princeton University.,6/17/47,Princeton,NJ,Princeton University,Nassau Hall
33,Harry Truman,Commencement Address at the University of California.,6/12/48,Berkeley,CA,,
33,Harry Truman,Commencement Address at the University of Missouri.,6/9/50,Columbia,MO,,
33,Harry Truman,Commencement Address at Howard University.,6/13/52,Washington,DC,Howard University,unknown
```

`.tsv` is an extension for *tab separated value* files. These are also text files, but the columns are separated by tabs instead of commas. Sometimes these will be `.txt` extension files.

```
president   president_name    title    date    city    state    building    room
33    Harry Truman    Commencement Address at Princeton University.    6/17/47    Princeton    NJ    Princeton University    Nassau Hall

The package `readr` provides a fast and friendly way to ready rectangular text data into `R`.

Here is an example csv file from fivethirtyeight.com on how to choose your college major (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).

```{r}
# load readr
library(readr)

# read a csv
recent_grads <- read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv")
```

`read_csv()` is just one way to read a file using the `readr` package.

- `read_delim()`: the most generic function. Use the delim argument to read a file with any type of delimiter
- `read_tsv()`: read tab separated files
- `read_lines()`: read a file into a vector that has one element per line of the file
- `read_file()`: read a file into a single character element
- `read_table()`: read a file separated by space
