Midterm exam to be held in class **Thursday, Oct 20**.

Bring:

- Pencil & eraser (No calculators allowed or necessary, don't use a pen.)
- One page formula sheet (8.5x11in, front and back, no worked examples)

I will supply:

- Table of common distributions
- Scratch paper

This exam covers material in the class notes through October 18 and Homeworks 1-7. For extra practice, see Rizzo Chapters 2,3, and 6.

To study:

- Go over your homework in detail. If you do not fully understand a problem, ask your peers and come to office hours.
- Re-read your class notes. Be sure you understand every example.
- Create a good formula sheet. This will help you learn the material.

Test Format:

- Similar to homework, but no R programming required.
- Short answer, derivations, pseudo-code to demonstrate you understand how to construct an algorithm for a specific problem.
- I could ask you to find an error in written code or tell me what the result of a block of code will be.
- Did you understand the concept? Which method to use when?
