# Your turn
# 1. Coverage for CI for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is known, $\left(\overline{x} - z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline{x} + z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$.
# a. Simulate $X_1, \dots, X_n \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, 1)$. Compute the empirical coverage for a $95%$ confidence interval for $n = 5$ using $m = 1000$ MC samples.
# b.  Plot 100 confidence intervals using `geom_segment()` and add a line indicating the true value for $\mu = 0$. Color your intervals by if they contain $\mu$ or not.
# c. Repeat the Monte Carlo estimate of coverage 100 times. Plot the distribution of the results. This is the Monte Carlo estimate of the distribution of the coverage.


#2. Repeat part 1 but without $\sigma$ known. Now you will plug in an estimage for $\sigma$ (using `sd()`) when you estimate the CI using the same formula that assumes $\sigma$ known. 
# What happens to the empirical coverage? What can we do to improve the coverage? Now increase $n$. What happens to coverage?
  

#3. Repeat 2a. when the data are distributed $\text{Unif}[-1, 1]$ and variance unknown. What happens to the coverage? What can we do to improve coverage in this case and why?
